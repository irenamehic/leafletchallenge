# leafletchallenge

In this homework assignment we needed to create a map using leaflet showing earthquakes from JSON data on the USGS website. The map has data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
